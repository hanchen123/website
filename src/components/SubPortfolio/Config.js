      galaxy products based on his selections of several steps. It's currently used for galaxy s8/s9/note8 purchase.
      <br><br>I lead a front-end group of 3 people to develop this project from ground up, and delivered it into production 
      within 3 weeks.<br><br>This project is built on React/Redux in combination with Sass, and page transition is handled by 
      history API so each step can be cached and deeplinked in browser. It's full responsive and well tagged for marketing 
      purpose. All the data is retrieved by RESTful API.`,
